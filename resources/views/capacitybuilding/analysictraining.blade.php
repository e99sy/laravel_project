        </div>

        <p> Our research aims to ensure adequate statistical power to detect associations between risk factors and cognitive
            outcomes, such as Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). These considerations are crucial for
            building a research infrastructure capable of generating reliable and valid results in Nepal.</p>

                <h5><strong>Power Analysis:</strong></h5>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Prevalence Estimates:</strong></li>
                    <p>Based on prior data, we estimate a 15% prevalence for cognitive impairment in the rural setting of
                        Chitwan Valley and a 5% prevalence for ADRD.</p>
                    <li><strong>Statistical Power:</strong></li>

                    <p>With a sample size of 4,000 and a 5% significance level, we expect to have adequate power to detect
                        associations for various risk factors. Power calculations show good capability for detecting
                        sex-specific effects and other significant variables.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sex-Specific Analysis:</strong></li>
                <p>Since previous studies have shown mixed results regarding sex differences in ADRD risk, we will
                    explore sex-specific models and interaction effects between sex and predictor variables to
                    understand these differences in the Nepali population.</p>
