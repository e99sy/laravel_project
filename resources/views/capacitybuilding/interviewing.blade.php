<div><h2>Research Capacity Building Activities</h2></div>

    <p>Our research capacity building program aims to strengthen the ability to conduct clinical and population studies on <strong>Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD)</strong> and other chronic health conditions associated with aging. The program has two primary goals:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strengthen survey data collection methods, with a focus on culturally informed ADRD assessments.</li>
            <li>Build and enhance statistical analysis methods for longitudinal population studies.</li>
        </ul>
        The activities focus on training Nepali investigators, who will then train others in academic and clinical settings across Nepal.
    </p>
