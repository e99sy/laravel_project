                <h2>Rationale</h2>
                <p>
                    Population aging is becoming increasingly more common in many low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).
                    As a result, these countries face the growing burden of common age-associated chronic illnesses,
                    including ADRD. Nepal is a low middle-income country where the population is now aging, putting a rising
                    number of adults at risk of developing ADRD. There is little or no research in Nepal to investigate the
                    scope and primary determinants of ADRD, and even the most basic information on ADRD is currently
                    lacking. There is an urgent need to build expertise in the design and conduct of systematic
                    population-level investigations of ADRD in Nepal. There is an equally urgent need to start collecting
                    rigorous new data on the scope and determinants of ADRD and other aging-related changes in health to
                    guide the development of prevention strategies and reduce the burden of ADRD in Nepal.

                <h2>Objectives / Research Questions</h2>
                <p>This study aims to answer the three specific research questions: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Are exposure to armed conflict and traumatic events associated with higher risk of ADRD?</li>
                    <li>Is international labor migration experience associated with a higher risk of ADRD?</li>
                    <li>Does the interaction between genetic predisposition and environmental factors modify the risk of
                        ADRD?</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p><strong>Sampling:</strong> The study follows a longitudinal cohort design, focusing on a representative
                    sample of
                    4000 older adults and their caregivers, drawn from the Chitwan Valley population. Frail adults with life
                    expectancy less than six months are excluded.</p>
                <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Data is collected through face-to-face Computer-Assisted Personal
                    Interviewing
                    (CAPI), which includes cognitive and physical function tests, self-report instruments, and assessments
                    of
                    weight, height, and blood pressure.</p>
