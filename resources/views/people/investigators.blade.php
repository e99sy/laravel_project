                    <p>
                        Dr. Ghimire studies social change, developmental idealism, family and demography, population and
                        environment dynamics. His research within family and demography revolves around three sub areas-
                        marriage (marital arrangement, marital relationship and relationship dynamics), childbearing (timing
                        of first birth), and fertility limitation (contraceptive use). In addition, he also studies
                        reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and mental health and well-being. Another major area of Dr. Ghimire’s
                        research focuses on understanding of the interplay between population and environmental processes
                        (reciprocal impacts of population processes on land use and terrestrial biodiversity, and
                        environmental degradation on childbearing, contraceptive use, individual mobility and household
                        energy use). More recently his work has focused on ideational aspects of these substantive areas.

                        Prof. Dr. Carlos F. Mendes de Leon is a professor of Epidemiology at the University of Michigan. His
                        research involves epidemiology of late life health, social epidemiology, health disparities,
                        psychosocial risk factors for disease and disability, longitudinal methods. He is Co-Principal
                        Investigator of the study and as Co-PI, Mendes de Leon jointly with Dr. Ghimire will oversee all
                        administrative and scientific aspects of the proposed research plan, including coordination among
                        project collaborators, project planning, design and refinement of data collection instruments to
                        measure ADRD, and venomous blood sample collection for genotyping. In the analysis portion of the
                        project, he will lead the estimate of prevalence rate and socioeconomic predictors of ADRD. He will
                        work closely together with Dr. Ghimire, Dr. Briceno-Abreu, Dr. Mitchel and Dr. Langa to oversee all
                        study activities involved in this project.

                    <p><strong>Clinical Neuropsychologist and Clinical Associate Professor</strong> - in the department of
                        Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the University of Michigan.</p>
                    <p>
                        As a clinical neuropsychologist, she has extensive training, clinical and research experience in
                        neuropsychology with diverse patient populations, including the neuropsychological assessment of
                        dementia. She is currently an investigator on several NIH-funded studies, including several studies
                        that use the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP), the cognitive assessment protocol for
                        the current project. Dr. Briceno-Abreu is Co-PI of a NIA funded R24 pilot project, which aims to
                        utilize cultural neuropsychological procedures to optimize cross national comparisons of cognitive
                        assessment data from studies within the HCAP International Network. She is also a Co-Investigator on
                        the NIH-funded BASIC-Cognitive study, an R01 that aims to ascertain the prevalence and impact of
                        dementia in Mexican Americans, and on another R01 in this cohort that aims to examine caregiver
                        decision-making and longer-term cognitive trajectories across Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic
                        whites. These projects use the HCAP instruments to assess cognitive health and its trajectories in
                        this culturally and linguistically diverse population. As the neuropsychologist investigator, she
                        will be responsible for the implementation and interpretation of the HCAP assessments, particularly
                        in considering the impact of demographic, linguistic, and cultural factors to optimize precision in
                        measurement of cognition. She will also develop and provide training for the field office staff on
                        cognitive testing with the HCAP assessment instrument and oversee quality assurance. In addition she
                        will also be involved in data analysis, and presentation and publication of results. In the analysis
                        portion of the project, he will lead the analyses of international migration and ADRD.

                        Michigan. Dr. Mitchell’s research utilizes a range of biological data types such as epigenetics,
                        neuroimaging, and genetics to better understand how social conditions shape population health. In
                        particular his work uses these biomarkers to elucidate pathways by which social inequalities cause
                        health inequalities. This research uses longitudinal population-based studies. He is Co-Investigator
                        in the project and will be responsible to oversee the analysis linking genetic propensity,
                        international labor migration to ADRD.

                    <p>
                        His research has focused on the risk factors and outcomes for chronic disease in older adults, with a special emphasis on Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias, and has published more than 225 peer-reviewed articles on these topics. He has collaborated with the HRS study team since 1998. Dr. Langa was Lead Investigator on the original HRS dementia sub-study, the ADAMS, from 2002 through 2010, and a Co-Investigator on the HRS-HCAP competing revision, working closely with David Weir in developing the HCAP protocol fielded by the HRS in 2016. Dr. Langa currently serves as the Principal Investigator of the NIA-funded HRS-HCAP study. He will provide expertise in aligning the HCAP cognitive assessment and dementia algorithms in this study with those applied in other international studies of dementia, in particular the HRS Network of Studies on Aging. Dr. Langa will provide guidance on overall implementation of HCAP.
